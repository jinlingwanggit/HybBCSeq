## Overview

HybBCSeq is a suite of bioinformatics tools that is used to process and analyze next-generation sequening data generated by the Hybridoma Barcoded Sequencing workflow.

- Demultiplex and bin NGS data to its well of origin
- Cleaning of the NGS data to screen for productive antibody variable domain sequences
- Report the antibody varaible domain sequences for each well

## Prerequisite

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Puthon 2.7
- virtualenv 15.1.0
- Git 2.7.4
- flash 1.2.11 (Included in the HybBCSeq-working directory)

## Installation/Download
- Perform git clone with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kamhonhoi/HybBCSeq.git
```

## Usage

#### 1.Retrieve raw NGS sequence files (.gz extension) from the source sequencer location to the HybBCSeq-working/samples directory
#### 2.In order to run the provided scripts, activate virtualenv with the following command: source HybBCSeq-venv/bin/activate
```
a. Note: to end virtualenv session, use command --- deactivate
b. Change into the HybBCSeq-working directory (i.e. cd HybBCSeq-working)
```
